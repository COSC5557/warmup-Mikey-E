## Brief description of results

In this warmup, I trained a linear model for regression and decision tree for classification.

Baseline error for regression is median guessing and averages about 60% off for each value.
The linear model achieves better performance, averaging around 46% error.

Baseline error for classification is reliably around 50% as expected since this is random-baseline guessing for a binary classification problem.
The decision tree performs very well with around 1.7% error every time.
