## Brief description of results

In this warmup, I trained a linear model for regression and decision tree for classification.

Baseline accuracy for regression is median guessing and averages about 44%.
The linear model achieves better performance, averaging around 63% accuracy.

Baseline accuracy for classification is reliably around 50% as expected since this is random-baseline guessing for a binary classification problem.
The decision tree performs very well with around 98% accuracy every time.
